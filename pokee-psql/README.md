# PSQL - Pokee Query Language

PSQL (_Pokee's ~~Shitty~~ Query Language_) is a minimalistic and incomplete Query Language for, well, querying stuff.

## Limitations

This is just a proof of concept web framework and should _not_ be used in production.
It is not secure, not optimized, not feature-complete, not tested, not maintained, not documented, and not suitable for
any real-world use case.
It is just a fun project to learn more about compilers / interpreters and how they work.
