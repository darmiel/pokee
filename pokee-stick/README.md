# PSWF - Pokee Web Framework

PSWF (_Pokee's ~~Shitty~~ Web Framework_) is a minimalistic and incomplete Web Server and -Framework.
It provides basic functionalities to handle incoming requests.

## Limitations

This is just a proof of concept web framework and should _not_ be used in production. 
It is not secure, not optimized, not feature-complete, not tested, not maintained, not documented, and not suitable for any real-world use case. 
It is just a fun project to learn more about web frameworks and how they work.
